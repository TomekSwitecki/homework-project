[Homework.com](https://tomekswitecki.github.io/homework-project/#/landing) is an application designed to simplify online education for both students and teachers. The platform allows faculty members to easily create courses and assignments, while students can view and submit assignments within a user-friendly interface, eliminating the burdensome process of submitting/gathering assignments through email.
